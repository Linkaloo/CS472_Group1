/*
 * This function calculates the inverse square root of a floating-point number x using a fast approximation method originally popularized by the Quake 3 video game.
 * Method:
 *   Initialization:
 *     Initialize a variable xhalf to half of x.
 *     Interpret the floating-point number x as an integer using a pointer cast, storing it in an integer variable i.
 *
 *   Magic Number and Bit Manipulation:
 *     The magic number 0x5f3759df is subtracted from a right-shifted version of i by 1.
 *     This operation effectively applies an initial approximation for the inverse square root.
 *
 *   Interpretation:
 *     Interpret the modified integer i as a floating-point number, storing it back into x.
 *     This step sets up an initial approximation for the inverse square root.
 *
 *   Refinement:
 *     Refine the approximation using a single iteration of Newton's method.
 *     The refinement is done by multiplying x by 1.5 - xhalf * x * x.
 *     This step improves the accuracy of the approximation.
 *
 *   Return:
 *     Return the refined approximation of the inverse square root.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   Input:
 *     x: The floating-point number for which the inverse square root is to be calculated.
 *
 *   Output:
 *     Returns the approximate inverse square root of x.
 *
 * Benefits:
 *   Speed:
 *     This implementation provides a very fast approximation of the inverse square root compared to traditional methods.
 *   Accuracy:
 *     Despite being an approximation, the function provides reasonable accuracy for many use cases.
 *   Simplicity:
 *     The function is concise and requires minimal lines of code.
 *   Historical Significance:
 *     This method gained fame through its use in the Quake 3 video game and has become a classic example of a fast approximation algorithm.
 *
 * Example Usage:
 *   float result = InvSqrt(25.0f); // Calculates the inverse square root of 25
 *
 * Note:
 *   While this method is fast and historically significant, it may not provide the same level of accuracy as more modern algorithms.
 *   Care should be taken when using this function in scenarios where precision is critical.
 *   This implementation relies on specific characteristics of floating-point representation and may not work as expected on all platforms or with all compilers.
