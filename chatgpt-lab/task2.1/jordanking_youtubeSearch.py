# This program demonstrates how the Python web scraping module Selenium can be used to open a Chrome process, automatically search
# something up on YouTube, and play the first video result. As an added flex, this program can also fullscreen both the Chrome process
# and the YouTube video, and it can skip an ad if one is playing.
